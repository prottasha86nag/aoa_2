         <h2>Summer</h2>  
         <p>Summer is the first season in the Bengali calendar of Bangladesh when a new year starts. Grisman ritu takes place in the months of Baisakh and Jaistha. It is a very hot season. Many rivers are dried up, and the climate remains humid most of the time, making it unbearable for people. The hot weather is extreme during this time. April is the month when the temperature goes to its maximum. Scorching heat makes the land dry and barren. </p>

         <h3>Rainly Season</h3>
         <p>This season is followed after the Grisma ritu. Mainly, Barsa ritu is seen during the months of Ashar and Shravan. Heavy rainfall takes place during this season. But this is much needed after the hot scorching summer season. It fills up the dried wells and rivers with water. The negative side of this season is that sometimes it leads to floods, hindering people’s daily activities up there. The barsa ritu continues from May till mid-October. </p>

         <h4>Winter</h4>
         <p>The Winter season usually falls in the Pous and Magh months of the Bengali calendar. From the north, chilly winds are blowing. It is a dry season with occasional rainfalls of less than 4%. It can be seen that the days are shorter, but the nights are longer, and the people would be seen around the fireplace covering themselves from head to toe. Fog will disappear late in the morning, acting as an obstacle to people’s visions while they are riding.
           It usually lasts till February. Mid-December is thought to be the coolest during the winter season.<br>
